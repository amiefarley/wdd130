        <p>Hey Everyone, I am Amie Farley. I am from Salt Lake City, Utah. I have been 
            working for 3M for about 4 -1/2 years as a healthcare IT analyst. I got the 
            job because I got my associates in Computer Science. I have been meaning to 
            get started on my bachelors for well over a year, but finally got started 
            last semester. In my free time I typically play Age of Empires 2, which is a 
            pretty old computer game that is super fun, or I will play with the dogs. 
            Previously my nephews lived with me so I would spend a lot of time playing 
            with them. They are both younger than 10 years old. But now that they are in 
            a new apartment with their dad, I will need to find some new hobbies. Or 
            spend more time on my hobbies that I haven't done much with lately. 
            Occasionally I will go Scuba diving. I have really only been diving in Utah, 
            but I am hoping to try it in Hawaii some time soon.</p>
